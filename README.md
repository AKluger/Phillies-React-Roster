# Phillies-React-Roster
A simple memory game to help the user become more familiar with players on the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team and highlight my abilities as a developer with React.

### How To Play
Click on a player's image to start the game.  This will increment your score and shuffle the cards.  The goal of the game is to select a new player after each shuffle.  If you repeat a player your score will reset to zero.  

### App Organization
The app is a single-page application built with the Create-React-App framework.  I have built a variety of presentational components with DOM manipulation being conducted by changes to the State of the App class component.  Props are handed down to the player card so we can track distinct players.  Scores, guesses, and success messages are all stored in App state.
